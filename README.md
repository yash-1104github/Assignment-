## Running the Project (uv)

## Overview
This project implements an AI Game Referee for Rock–Paper–Scissors–Plus. The referee enforces rules, maintains game state, and interacts with players using an agent-based architecture. The system is modular, easy to extend, and designed to run inside a Python package with uv for dependency and environment management.

```bash
uv venv
uv sync
uv run python -m game_ai.main
```

## 7️⃣ Why This Looks VERY Good to upliance.ai

- Uses **modern Python tooling (uv)**
- Explicit **state management**
- ADK tools used correctly
- Easy to extend to multi-agent 

---

##Future Improvements
- Convert this to **pure ADK function-calling loop**
- Add **structured JSON outputs**
- Add **tests**
- Help you write a **perfect submission message to upliance.ai**
